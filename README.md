# Step 1

Create a Dogs component that...
* fetches a list of dog breeds from `https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/list/all` 
* displays fetched dog breeds as items in an unordered list of buttons
* allows users to click on dog breeds in list and add them to a "Favorite Dog Breeds List"

# Step 2

Refactor your app, maintaining all existing functionality...
* into two components, one called Dogs (lists clickable dog breeds) and one called FavDogs (lists chosen favorite dog breeds)

# Step 3

Add routing so that a user...
* Views the List of Dog Breeds as the landing page
* Can navigate to the Favorite Dog Breeds List as a separate page
